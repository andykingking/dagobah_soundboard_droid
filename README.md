# Dagobah soundboard (Android)

## Purpose

This project allowed me to experiment with native Android development. 

## Notes

* This project has an arbitrary SDK version target. This only needed to run on emulators/devices that I already owned or installed.
* The code isn't perfect, as the intent is to focus on one element of the Android development ecosystem at a time. Watch this space for refactoring.
* Feedback is appreciated, feel free to [contact me](mailto:me@andrewsking.com?subject=Feedback on Dagobah Soundboard Android).
